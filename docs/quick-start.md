# Quick Start

## Product Overview

Our **Openterface‚Ñ¢ Mini-KVM** allows you to control a nearby headless computer (which we refer to as the **Target**) directly from your own laptop or desktop (referred to as the **Host**), via usb and HDMI connection, without the need for an extra keyboard, mouse, monitor or network.

## Connection Instructions

To set up your Mini-KVM, follow these steps:

- **Host Computer Connection**: Connect the Type-C port located on the orange end of the Mini-KVM to your host computer.
- **Target Device Connection**:
    - **Video Output**: Connect the HDMI port on the black end to the video output of the target device. Depending on the available video output ports on the target computer, you may need an appropriate video adapter.
    - **Type-C Connection**: Attach the Type-C port on the black end to the target device.
