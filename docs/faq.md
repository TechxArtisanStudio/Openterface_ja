      - The application for the host computer is currently compatible with macOS.
      - We are also working on building host applications to support other operating systems, such as Windows and Linux.
- Target Devices
      - The Openterface Mini-KVM is compatible with any device that can output its screen display through an HDMI port and input simulated Keyboard/Mouse HID control signals via a USB port. Thus, it supports to control over most of devices operating on Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and iOS.

### **Can the Openterface Mini-KVM support file transfers between the host and target device?**

   - Yes, the Openterface Mini-KVM includes a switchable USB-A port shared between the host and target devices. With a usb stickdisk plugged into this port, files are able to transfer between host and target by following steps:
      1. Mount a usb stick drive on host, when the small black switch is on the side of host type-c port, then
      2. Copy the files onto this mounted drive. After copying, 
      3. Unmount the drive without physically unplugging it; Instead, 
      4. Simply flip the small black switch to other side. This action switches the USB-A port's connection to the the target. Next,
      5. Mount the usb stick on the target device and copy/move files off the drive, completing the transfer process of files from host to target. 
      
      This method can also be used in the opposite direction.

### **Can the switchable USB-A port be toggled at the software level? Could this be achieved through a button instead?**
   - The current design does not support toggling at the software level; it can only be physically flipped for now.
   - Implementing toggling at the software level would necessitate a new design, incorporating a button and an LED indicator (either green/blue or on/off) to signify whether the USB port is set to the host or target mode. Additionally, this would require the integration of an additional chip, leading to increased costs in both hardware and software development. The existing design represents a compromise, aimed at balancing between cost-efficiency and basic functionality. Despite the potential for increased costs, we are interested in incorporating this feature in a future version for better user experience.
