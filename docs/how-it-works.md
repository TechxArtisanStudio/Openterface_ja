# How It Works

## Process Breakdown

- **Screen Streaming**: The mini-KVM captures the screen stream from the target computer and displays it on the host computerâ€™s app. This allows users to view and manage the target system directly from their host machine.
- **Cursor and Mouse Control**: By moving the mouse to the app window on the host computer, users can control the cursor on the target device as if they were using a VNC. This functionality enables operating two systems simultaneously on one screen.
- **Keyboard Input**: When the app window is active, any keystrokes made on the host computerâ€™s keyboard are transmitted to the target device, allowing for seamless typing and command entry.
- **HID Signal Conversion**: All keyboard and mouse inputs within the app are converted into Human Interface Device (HID) control signals, which are then sent to the target computer.
- **Synchronization**: The app ensures that the target computerâ€™s screen and cursor are synchronized with the host computerâ€™s display, facilitating a unified user experience.
