This is Github repo for hosting Openterface Mini-KVM's Website.

We've reached a pivotal moment: our [Pre-launch Page](https://www.crowdsupply.com/techxartisan/openterface-mini-kvm) is now live on **Crowd Supply**! This is a crucial step towards our official crowdfunding campaign, and we're eager to make it a success. By subscribing and considering to be our backer, you'll bring us closer to our goal and, ultimately, to delivering Mini-KVM Openterface to you faster.

**Openterface Mini-KVM** allows you to control a headless target device, such as a mini PC, kiosk, or server, directly from your laptop or desktop without the need for an extra keyboard, mouse, and monitor.

It's a plug-and-play tool that connects via HDMI for display and USB for emulated keyboard/mouse (HID) signals. It requires minimal setup: install our host application on your host computer, and you're ready to have on-the-go headless control.

## Control Your Devices Whenever and Wherever
